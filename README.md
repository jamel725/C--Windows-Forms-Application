# C--Windows-Forms-Application
Developed a full-featured client-server Windows Forms application using C# and .NET 6.0, enabling real-time image transfer and interactive communication over TCP sockets. Implemented a responsive, event-driven graphical user interface with custom layouts and image-based buttons. Designed modular components including a main form and custom user controls to simulate the separation, transport, and reconstruction of RGB image channels. Integrated multithreaded server logic to handle multiple client connections concurrently, and incorporated robust file and image handling for seamless data exchange. Demonstrated strong object-oriented programming, GUI development, and debugging skills within the Visual Studio environment across the entire development lifecycleâ€”from design and implementation to testing and deployment.
